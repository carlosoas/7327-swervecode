# 7327-swervecode
Hello anyone who is looking at this, I am currently trying to improve apoun this code for the andymark swerve.
Currently driving works and so does 45 spins as I am having trouble rotating while moving. 
The only form of feedback on this robot in regards to angle is the MA3 encoder as I am currently not using the built in encoders on the PG71 motor.
If any improvement is made please feel free to email me at Carlossosa0722@gmail.com
for the time being I will be working on automous for the current state of the code as the robot is atleast driveable.
